# Terms and Conditions for PriceMyData

### These are the terms and conditions you agree to when you use <a>https://pricemydata.com</a>
Hi! This isn't a long and convoluted document, but does, in a concise manner, detail the Terms and Conditions you agree to when you use <a>https://pricemydata.com</a> to put a value to your precious data. Do feel free to reach out to <a href="https://raghavmecheri.me">me</a> if you have any questions, or would like to talk!

## Terms and Conditions:

1. PriceMyData does <b>not</b> store any of your personal data from Google or Facebook, the system only reads the data, computes a value, and discards the data passed to it.
2. PriceMyData <b>does, however</b> store the numeric values that you enter for each survey question posed to an end user. The purpose of PriceMyData is to crowdfund data valuations, so these numeric values are stored anonymously.
3. Again, thank you for trusting us with your data, we <b>do not store any of your personal information!</b>
4. In the event of a breach, PriceMyData will not be personally responsible for any of the data exposed. However, since we don't store anything except anonymous crowndfunded values which I plan to release to the public eventually, the consequences will be next to harmless :)

Thank you for your time, and I hope you find <a href="https://pricemydata.com">PriceMyData</a> useful!
